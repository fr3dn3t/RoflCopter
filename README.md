# RoflCopter
My RoflCopter makes swush swush swush - just kidding. The RoflCopter a monocopter, monospinner, gyropter, drone whatever you want to call it.

I'm working on this project since October 2015 and until now, there have been two versions. The first Version was built to test various parameters and hardware approaches to make it fly - Version 1 was completed in May 2016, but never flew.
Applying the lessons learned from the first version I started to build a secont one. This one was completly designed via CAD and the rotor blades were simulated in XFLR5. A full documentation can be found in V2/docs/ (german only), the first successful flight was on 14th February 2017 [Video](https://github.com/fr3dn3t/RoflCopter/blob/master/V2/videos/RoflCopter%20-%20FirstFlight14022017.mp4)
